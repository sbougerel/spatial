Spatial test README
===================

In this folder are located the unit test files for the library. Since this
folder is supposed to be used to unit test the current development of the library,
the #include directives in this folder are using relative path to find the
files in the src/ directory. Therefore the test/ directory goes along with the
src/ directory.
